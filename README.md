**Hungry crab**

Loosely based on https://drewjewel.com/2015/03/25/chronicles-of-a-videogame-in-java-6-npcs/

The user is taken to the seaworld, deep into the ocean, where they have to collect as many pearls as they can, while staying out of danger!!!

Have fun!

This is a minimal version of the game, developed over the course of a couple of hours. Therefore, bugs and crashes do occur. However, feel free to experiment with the code and use your imagination to improve the game!
